# 42Philosophers

<p>The dining philosophers problem involves a scenario where a number of philosophers sit around a dining table with a bowl of spaghetti and a fork between each pair of adjacent philosophers. The philosophers spend their time thinking, eating and sleeping. However, to eat, a philosopher needs to use two forks - the one on their left and the one on their right.
The challenge is to design a concurrent algorithm to coordinate the philosopher's actions to avoid deadlock, where each philosopher is waiting indefinitely for a fork held by another philosopher, and to prevent resource contention, where two philosophers might attempt to use the same fork simultaneously.</p>
